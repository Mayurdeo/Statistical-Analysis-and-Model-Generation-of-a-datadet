# Statistical-Analysis-and-Model-Generation-of-a-datadet
Performed statistical analysis  on a dataset (based on a study on concreteâ€™s components). Generated the best possible model to predict the response i.e. the Compressive strength.
It involves the following steps:
1)Exploratory Data Analysis
2)Basic Model Generation
3)Forward Varaible Selection
4)Variable Transformation
5)Outlier Test
6)Diagnostic Test 
7)Predictive Modeling
